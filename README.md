# Password-Generator

In this project I created an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript.

The aim of this was to create Password Generator that generates a password when the button "generate password" is clicked.

When the button is clicked, the application presents a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
Character types to choose from:

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

The code is also validate for each input so at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed on the page.

As an additional challenge I have create a second button that copies the password to clipboard.

The application fully rensponsive for all the screen sizes.
